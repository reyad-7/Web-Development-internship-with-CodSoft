## Task 3: Basic Calculator
To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, I implemented an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator features a display screen to show user input and results. I utilized CSS grid for button alignments and employed event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops to handle user input and perform calculations.
